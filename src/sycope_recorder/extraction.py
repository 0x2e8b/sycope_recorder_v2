"""Builds the extraction filename/time-window and shells out to npcapextract.

This is the layer where alert data actually turns into a PCAP: it derives
the output filename and the [begin, end] extraction window from the alert
timestamp, invokes npcapextract as a subprocess with the BPF filter built
elsewhere (bpf.py), and classifies the outcome into one of four caller-facing
results (success URL, "no BPF filter", timeout, or failure). No packet
inspection happens here or anywhere in this codebase — npcapextract does
that; this module is orchestration around it.

    no BPF filter could be built (returns NO_BPF without ever invoking the
